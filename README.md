I’m a Biomedical Scientist with over five years of experience in healthcare. I recently completed the Code First Girls Degree in Software and Data Engineering and I’m now transitioning into tech. I’m actively looking for a Junior Software Engineering or Data Analyst role where I can keep learning and start contributing to real world projects.

I bring a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and experience working in high pressure environments. I’m excited to apply these skills while building my foundation in software development and data work.
